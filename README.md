# Lossy Image Compression Optimized for Downstream Task Performance

Train a deep learning-based lossy image compression model to improve downstream task performance on decompressed data.

## Scripts 
### `train.py`
Train a downstream task aware compressor, using a downstream model trained on uncompressed data and a downstream loss.

### `train_on_cifar10.py`
Train a classifier model on CIFAR-10, using either the Resnet18 or VGG16 architecture.
